# Text Editor Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Text Editor Project! This is a robust and user-friendly text editor built using modern web technologies. It's designed to help you create, edit, and manage your text files with ease.

## Tech Stack
Our text editor is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js 14**: We use Next.js, a powerful React framework, to build our user interface. It allows us to create fast, feature-rich applications with built-in server-side rendering.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types. It helps us write safer, self-documenting code and provides excellent developer tooling.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. We use it to rapidly build custom user interfaces without leaving our HTML.

- **Draft.js**: Draft.js is a JavaScript rich text editor framework, built for React and backed by an immutable model. We use it to provide you with a seamless, intuitive text editing experience.
